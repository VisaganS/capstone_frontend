# Gym Junkie

My capstone project for BrainStation's full-stack bootcamp involved conceptualizing, strategizing, and implementing a comprehensive full-stack application within a two-week timeframe. Gym Junkie was made using the following tech stack: reate-react-app, react-router, and SASS for the front end and Node/Express backend API with JWT for auth, and Knex to query a MySQL database.
